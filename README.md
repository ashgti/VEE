Virtual Embedded Environment (VEE)

VEE is designed for emulating embedded systems. Specifically the 
current version targets the Arduino Platform based on the Atmega 
chipset. The emulation layer is an implementation of the API with
limited access to the Atmega specific architecture, for instance 
you can directly access a specific set of pins for binary I/O.
